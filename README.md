## üåü The Nostalgic Vision

When a player logs into Eryndor, we want them to feel that same sense of wonder they had logging into their first MMORPG. Whether that was creating their first character in Elwynn Forest, starting fresh on Tutorial Island, or stepping off the boat in Freeport, we want to recapture that magic moment when everything felt possible.

**Our Promise**: Every system will be designed to foster the same social connections, meaningful progression, and sense of discovery that made classic MMORPGs special. We're not just building a game - we're creating a world where memories are made.

---

*"The best MMORPGs weren't just games - they were virtual worlds where friendships were forged, legends were born, and every login was the start of a new adventure. Eryndor will honor that legacy."*

**Next Steps**: Complete Phase 2 foundation systems, then begin Phase 3 core gameplay loops with heavy emphasis on the nostalgic elements that made classic MMORPGs unforgettable.
